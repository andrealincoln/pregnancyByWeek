          I aim to cover what I learned about pregnancy that wasn't immediately obvious to me.

          Certain drugs and foods that are typically harmless can pose risks during pregnancy, such as alcohol.
          The risk with food (e.g. deli meats, soft cheeses) often relates to infection, which can also endanger the
          fetus. Drugs generally considered toxic are
          likely to be harmful during pregnancy. However, there are many medications whose risks may seem
          surprising or random; for example, it is recommended that pregnant women avoid taking ibuprofen.
          I recommend explicitly consulting your doctor and/or researching any prescription or over-the-counter
          medication or supplement before use.

          Virtually all mild to moderate exercise is safe during pregnancy, but some activities may become challenging
          as pregnancy progresses. For intense exercises that carry a higher risk of injury or require extensive
          recovery, such as boxing or marathon running, it's wise to do some research beforehand. Staying in shape not
          only provides the usual health benefits but also potentially give you more endurance for labor.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Pregnancy impacts bodies in vastly different ways. To illustrate, 30% of individuals experience no morning
          sickness, while 3% suffer from severe vomiting multiple times a day, requiring special medical attention to
          manage dehydration and weight loss. Most fall somewhere in between. Pregnancy can also present various
          complications that affect approximately 5% of women. This leads to diverse experiences, ranging from those
          who find pregnancy effortless and insist it is a state of wellness, to others who endure significant
          hardships, such as frequent hospital visits, gestational diabetes, or complications that might necessitate
          bed rest. I say all of this to make horror stories less alarming while also reassuring you that not having a
          "normal pregnancy" is, in fact, very normal.
          Pregnancy often involves unique, unpredictable
          symptomsâ€”similar to a mild illness in the first trimester and akin to carrying an overly heavy backpack in
          the last. You'll face additional restrictions, like being unable to take most pain medications. For any
          specific issues that arise, consulting with your doctor and researching can let you mitigate issues.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Now, let me step onto my personal soapbox. Approximately 10% of women have hypothyroidism. Untreated or
          inadequately treated hypothyroidism is linked to adverse outcomes. While the U.S. is quite good at
          screening for hypothyroidism, considering the significance for pregnancy, I recommend asking your doctor to
          test your thyroid function if you are planning to try getting pregnant. If you have any of your own interesting
          health quirks make sure to bring them up to your doctor and read up on pregnancy with the condition.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          Pregnancy is, as my husband memorably put it, quite metal. Your body undergoes intense changes to accommodate
          the growth of a fetus into a baby. During this time, seemingly minor adjustments can have surprisingly
          significant impacts on the future child. Don't let this overwhelm you. We always operate under some level of
          uncertainty. Do your best, follow medical advice, and consider checking recent literature reviews for new
          and helpful insights.
